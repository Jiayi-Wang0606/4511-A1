# README

1. put directory`news_data` and `model_data` together with all `.py` scripts in one root directory
2. change the `loading_dir='/content/drive/MyDrive/Topic Mining Project/new_data/'`  to your own root directory

3. only run `demo.py` 

4. we hope to get updated data csv and model, which are all stored in directory`news_data` and `model_data`
